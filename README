This repository contains tools to prepare decks for distribution for the Decks iPad application by Cooliris.

To prepare a deck for distribution, simply follow these steps:
1) Open a new Terminal window
2) Drag and drop the "build-deck.sh" file onto the window
3) Drag and drop the directory containing the deck you want to distribute onto the window
4) Verify the content in the window looks something like:
   /Volumes/HDD/deck-builder/build-deck.sh /Volumes/HDD/deck-demo-welcome
5) Press [Return]
6) In case of success, the newly created deck will be on your Desktop as a .zip, otherwise, you will see error messages in the window

The validation tools perform these tasks:
- Make sure the XML in the .page and .include files is valid (IMPORTANT: This does not guarantee it is valid PageKit XML, just valid XML)
- Make sure the fonts used in the PageKit <string> blocks exist on the iPad
- Optimize PNG files for iOS

See http://developer.decksapp.com for documentation about distributing decks.
